# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implement Phase 1: scaffold Expo mobile app (offline-first), port design tokens, and prepare data schema.

## Recent Changes
- Created memory-bank with core files and seeded initial project context.
- Recorded decisions: mobile (React Native + Expo), offline-first, 4 categories, rank orders with subranks, English menus + Latin taxonomy, design reference provided.

## Next Steps
- Scaffold Expo app (TypeScript) with expo-router (tabs + stacks).
- Configure NativeWind with provided palette and Space Grotesk font.
- Define Taxon schema (including subranks) and category mapping rules.
- Prepare balanced starter dataset (≈16 species; 4 per category).
- Choose Wikimedia/GBIF images; bundle 1+ thumbnail per species with attribution.

## Open Questions
- Algae handling: exclude from "Seedless Plants" in MVP? (proposal: exclude)
- Minimum image size OK at ≥800px on long side for bundled thumbnails?
